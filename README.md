# XML Viewer

Comparable to a web browser, this project will display an XML file but without hyperlinks and advanced formatting.

## Getting Started

Visual Studio 2015 is suitable to compile this Windows Visual C++ MFC application. When run and compiled, in the File dropdown menu, choose "Open File" and select a valid XML file to view.

## History

The XML Viewer is an early work of mine. It was created to establish my own codebase to read an XML file while the specification was new. Since then, XML libraries have been released that are freely available and that are better established.
